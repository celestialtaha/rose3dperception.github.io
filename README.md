# Sparse 3D Perception for Rose Harvesting Robots: Project Page

This folder contains a minimal static website for GitHub Pages in the style of CVPR project pages.
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `<your-username>.github.io` (or a project site repo).
2. Upload the files from this folder to the repo root (or `docs/` for a project site).
3. Enable GitHub Pages in **Settings â†’ Pages** (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).
4. Replace `assets/img/teaser.png` with your teaser figure and add your own figures/videos.
5. Update links to the paper, code, and other resources as needed.

Template inspired by widely used CVPR project pages (e.g., Nerfies). Please keep the attribution note in the footer.
